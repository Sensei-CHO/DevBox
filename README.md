# DevBox

DevBox is a test server hosted on a [RPI 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

This repository is follows the updates and new deployments on this DevBox.

# Configuration

As said before, `DevBox` is hosted on a [RPI 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) as its OS.

## Apps

The [Apps](Apps/) folder contains the apps I created and tested on the `DevBox`.
These will probably have their own dedicated repository in the future.

## Deployments

The [Deployments](Deployments/) folder contains the things I deployed on my raspberry and its platforms likes `k3s` or `lxd`.
