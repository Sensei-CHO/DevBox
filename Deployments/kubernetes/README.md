# Kubernetes

In this documentation I'll deploy, test, creates apps and manage a single node kubernetes infrastructure, and maybe a multi-node cluster in the future.

- [Installation](installation/README.md) Installation of `k3s`.
- [Ingress and SSL](kubernetes/) Setup of Ingress controller and SSL certificates for our applications (comming soon).
- [Portainer](kubernetes/portainer/README.md) Deployments of `portainer` on our `kubernetes` node to deploy apps more easily. (Rolling back)
