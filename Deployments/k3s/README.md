# K3S

[K3S](https://k3s.io/) is a lightweight [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) distribution made for IOT, Edge Computing, and ARM processors.

In this documentation I'll deploy, test, creates apps and manage a single node k3s infrastructure, and maybe a multi-node cluster in the future.

- [Installation](installation/README.md) Installation of `k3s`.
- [Ingress and SSL](k3s/) Setup of Ingress controller and SSL certificates for our applications (comming soon).
- [Portainer](k3s/portainer/README.md) Deployments of `portainer` on our `k3s` node to deploy apps more easily.
